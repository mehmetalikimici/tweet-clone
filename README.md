# Tweet Clone 
I created a tweet clone. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with JavaScript along with CSS.<br>

As seen in the design, there is a counter containing the maximum number of characters. When this counter is full, the background of extra characters changes color and the tweet button is deactivated.
